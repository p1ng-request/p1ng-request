## Something I have been working on ðŸŽ¯

[broken-links-checker.py](https://github.com/p1ng-request/automation-scripts-best-pracitces/blob/main/broken-links-checker.py): A Python script to scan dead links from a given web domain.

[nlp-docs-scanner.py](https://github.com/p1ng-request/automation-scripts/blob/main/nlp-docs-scanner.py): Automated Documentation Scanner. Features:
+ Scan all .md files in a given directory and all the sub-directories and use natural language processing(NLP) techniques to determine complicated words by breaking down the text into individual sentences.
+ Grammar and Spelling checker.
+ Evaluate **readability**: the Flesch-Kincaid Reading Ease score.
+ Evalute the **objectivity**: by computing the Automated Readability Index (ARI) and Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level.
+ Evalute **clearity**: Apply named entity recognition (NER) to identify specific words within the text and make suggestions for improvements.
+ Evalue the **tone**: Apply Sentiment analysis using Machine learning (ML) techniques.
+ Evalute the **consistency**: Analyze the text based on NLP and ML, which, detects terms and check consistency.
+ Note: Grammar check, spelling check & clearity check on a word-based level proven to be unreliable for generating too many false positives. Best pracitce: use grammarly instead.
+ Sample promot:

> File: test.md
>
> Score: 11.9
> 
> ('The document appears to be written in a very subjective tone. Consider using more neutral language.', 'Tone')
> 
> ('The document appears to be written at a higher reading level than the target audience. Consider simplifying the language.', 'Readability')
> 
> ('The document appears to be written at a lower reading level than the target audience. Consider using more complex vocabulary.', 'Readability')
> 
> ('There are grammatical and/or spelling errors in the document. Consider running the document through a grammar and spell checker.', 'Grammar and Spelling')
> 
> The sentence: 'It allows data scientists to analyze data and visualize patterns with simple drag-and-drop operations.' has a low readability score of 6.5. Consider simplifying the language.
> 
> The word '{word}' is not consistent with the terms found in the rest of the documentation.", "Consistency"

+ Install dependencies:
```bash
## prereq: python3, jre
